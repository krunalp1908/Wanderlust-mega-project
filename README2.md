üöÄ End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline using GitHub, Docker, Jenkins, OWASP, SonarQube, Trivy, ArgoCD, Redis, AWS EKS & Helm

üìå Overview

This project implements a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for deploying applications to AWS EKS using GitHub, Jenkins, Docker, SonarQube, OWASP Dependency Check, Trivy, ArgoCD, Redis, Helm, Grafana & Prometheus.

Build & store application containers

Trivy

Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities

ArgoCD

Continuous deployment to AWS EKS

AWS EKS

Kubernetes cluster for running applications

Redis

Caching for optimized performance

Helm

Deploy applications & monitoring stack

Grafana & Prometheus

Application monitoring & alerting

‚ö° CI/CD Pipeline Workflow

1Ô∏è‚É£ Code Management (GitHub)

Developers push code to GitHub.

GitHub triggers the Jenkins CI pipeline via a webhook.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Continuous Integration (CI) (Jenkins)

‚úÖ Step 1: Dependency Security Check (OWASP Dependency Check)

Scans third-party libraries for vulnerabilities.

If high-risk vulnerabilities are found, the build fails.

‚úÖ Step 2: Code Quality Analysis (SonarQube)

Runs static code analysis.

If SonarQube's Quality Gate fails, the build stops.

‚úÖ Step 3: Build & Containerization (Docker)

If security & quality checks pass, Jenkins:

Builds a Docker image.

Tags the image with the Git commit hash.

Pushes the image to AWS ECR / Docker Hub.

‚úÖ Step 4: Filesystem Security Scan (Trivy)

Scans the Docker image for vulnerabilities.

If critical vulnerabilities exist, Jenkins fails the build.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Continuous Deployment (CD) (ArgoCD)

‚úÖ Step 5: Kubernetes Deployment (AWS EKS via ArgoCD)

ArgoCD automatically pulls the updated image from the registry.

Deploys the application on AWS EKS using Helm charts.

Uses Redis for caching.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring & Observability (Grafana & Prometheus)

Helm deploys Grafana & Prometheus to monitor:

CPU, memory, and disk usage.

Application logs.

Redis caching performance.

Alerts are triggered for performance issues or downtime.

üèóÔ∏è Setup Instructions

Prerequisites

AWS Account with EKS & ECR setup.

Jenkins installed with required plugins.

SonarQube & OWASP Dependency Check setup.

Deployment Steps

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/cicd-pipeline.git
cd cicd-pipeline

Set up Jenkins and configure GitHub Webhook.

Run Jenkins pipeline to execute CI steps.

Deploy using ArgoCD (automatically pulls updates to AWS EKS).

Monitor application performance using Grafana & Prometheus.
